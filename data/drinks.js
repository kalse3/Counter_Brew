It runs at far lower pressure than a real espresso machine, so it isn't technically espresso, but the cup it pulls is strong and concentrated enough to stand in for one. Drink it short and intense, or loosen it with hot water."

    notes: "Just about the most forgiving brew there is — coarse grind, four-minute steep, plunge, done. The metal mesh lets the oils through, so the cup comes out full-bodied and round rather than crisp. Hard to mess up, which is exactly why it's a staple."

    notes: "The French breakfast classic: equal parts strong brewed coffee and hot milk, with no foam to speak of. It's lighter than a latte and made for dunking a croissant. New Orleans does its own chicory-spiked version, if you ever want the variation."

    notes: "A neat trick most people don't realize the French press can do: pump cold milk and it whips into a light, sweet foam with zero special gear. Floated over iced coffee, it's the café cold-foam drink for nothing."

    notes: "The control freak's brew, in the best way — grind, water temperature, and pour rate are all yours to dial in. The paper filter traps the oils and fines, so the cup is clean and bright, the opposite of a French press. It rewards attention and single-origin beans."

    notes: "Vietnamese iced coffee, built around the little metal phin drip filter and a layer of sweetened condensed milk. Traditionally it's strong dark robusta, and the slow drip pulls a thick, almost syrupy concentrate — the bitterness and the sweet milk are made for each other.

    notes: "No heat at all — just coarse grounds and cold water left to steep overnight. Skipping the heat skips most of the acidity and bitterness, so it comes out smooth, mellow, and naturally a little sweet. It's a concentrate, so most people cut it with water or milk."

The coffee is ground to a powder and simmered unfiltered in a long-handled pot called a cezve, so the grounds settle at the bottom of the cup. Sugar goes in during brewing, never after — and don't drink the last sip. (Greek coffee is the same drink under a different name.)"

The blending is what defines it — skip it and you just get oily coffee. An acquired taste, but its fans are devoted."
